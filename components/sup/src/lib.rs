//! Biome helps you build, manage, and run applications - on bare metal, in the cloud, and in
//! containers. You can [read more about it on the website](https://www.habitat.sh/).
//!
//! Biome contains two main components:
//!
//! * `bio-plan-build`, takes a plan ('plan.sh'), a description of how to build a piece of software,
//! written in [bash](http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prog-Intro-HOWTO.html), which produces an atomic
//! package.
//! * `bio-sup`, a run-time executable that knows how to download, install, serve, and
//! manage services defined in packages.
//!
//! # bio-plan-build
//!
//! The documentation for bio-plan-build is generated automatically from the script itself, [and
//! can be found here](bio-plan-build/bio-plan-build.html). You can find it in the source tree at
//! `components/plan-build`.
//!
//! # The Supervisor
//!
//! The Supervisor is primarily utilized through the `bio-sup` command; it can also be used from
//! within Rust as a library. This documentation covers both uses; it explains how things are used
//! from the command line in close proximity to the documentation of the library itself. A few
//! useful starting points:
//!
//! * [The Biome Command Line Reference](command)
//! * [The Biome Supervisor Sidecar; http interface to promises](sidecar)
