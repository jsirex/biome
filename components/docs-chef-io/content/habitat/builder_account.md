Whether you are looking to leverage the SaaS or on-prem version of Biome Builder, you will need to create an account on the SaaS version of Biome Builder. After you have then downloaded the version, you will then sync the two accounts.

## Prerequisites

You need to set a few things up before you can get started with Biome Builder:

* Download and install the [Biome CLI]({{< relref "install_habitat" >}})
* A [GitHub account](https://github.com/join)

## Sign-in and Authorize Biome Builder

Biome Builder automatically creates your account the first time you sign in using the GitHub authentication process. You'll also need to authorize the Biome Builder application in Github.
