# In this test, the Supervisors use ring encryption to secure
# Supervisor-to-Supervisor communication with each other.
#
# However, the `alpha` Supervisor is not configured to participate
# with encryption. It will start up, but none of the gossip will get
# to it.
#
# To test this, we upload a file to the bastion and verify that it
# gets to the Supervisor that does participate with encryption
# (`beta`), but no the one that doesn't (`alpha`).
